# Rock or Mine Predictor
This repository hosts a machine learning model for predicting whether SONAR data represents a Mine or Rock, implemented in Python using `numpy`, `pandas`, and `scikit-learn` with Logistic Regression.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing is [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parthdevrani/sonarcsv], containing un-labelled SONAR data samples.
You can also get the CSV file in this repository as well.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NavneetKishanS/rock-or-mine-predicter.git
   cd sonar-data-classification
2. **Open and Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
  Upload sonar_classification.ipynb to Google Colab.
Execute notebook cells to train the model and evaluate its performance.
3. **Dependencies:**
Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn

## Results
View the model's accuracy on the test dataset and explore predictions within the notebook.
